# Learn Graph Data Structures in Go

<img src="gopher.svg" alt="gopher" width="100"/>

In this repository, you will learn the basics and how to implement and test:

* [Graphs](graph): A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set
  of edges connecting these vertices.
* [Stacks](stack): A stack is a linear data structure that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
  principle [Read more](stack)
* [Queues](queue): A queue is a linear data structure that follows the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO)
  principle. [Read more](queue)
* [Depth-First Search (DFS)](dfs): A search algorithm that explores the vertices of a graph in a depth-first manner.
    * [Recursive DFS](dfs/recursive_dfs.go)
    * [Stack DFS](dfs/stack_dfs.go)
* [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](bfs): A search algorithm that explores the vertices of a graph in a breadth-first manner.
    * [Queue BFS](bfs/queue_bfs.go)

# What's worth about this repository?

âœ… Everything has TESTS! I highly recommend to clone this repo and remove my implementations so you can code your own and
then follow a TDD approach.
