# Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting
these vertices. The edges may be directed, meaning that they have a direction associated with them, or they may be
undirected, meaning that they do not have a direction associated with them.

In a graph, each vertex represents a piece of data, and the edges between the vertices represent relationships or
connections between the data. For example, in a social network, the vertices might represent individual people, and the
edges might represent relationships such as friendships or family connections. In a transportation network, the vertices
might represent cities, and the edges might represent roads or airline routes connecting the cities.

Graphs are often used to represent real-world relationships and connections, and they can be useful for modeling and
analyzing complex systems. There are many algorithms and techniques for working with graphs, including traversing the
graph to visit all of the vertices and edges, finding the shortest path between two vertices, and identifying clusters
or communities within the graph. In this repository, we are only covering the Depth First Search algorithm and Breadth
First Search algorithm.
